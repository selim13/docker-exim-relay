# exim-router

This is a base Exim docker image configured to act as a relay with some basic 
`main`, `acl` and `retry` defaults.

No `routers`, `transports` or `authenticators` are configured, so by default it will
fail delivering all mail.

You can use it as a base for your docker images. Put your configuration 
either to `/etc/exim/exim.conf` or to the following included files:
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/main.conf`
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/acl.conf`
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/routers.conf`
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/transports.conf`
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/retry.conf`
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/rewrite.conf`
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/authenticators.conf`
* `/etc/exim/conf.d/local_scan.conf`
